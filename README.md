# PortfolioProject

Website created for my personal portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have used some Font-Awesome and Devicons for social and programming icons.

---

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my portfolio with a page
dedicated to showing the projects I have built or worked on.

---

Web page includes all my social media links, CV download and contact form
which is submitted using Formspree. Some elements are interactive with mouse over/hover and I also have included a dark/light mode theme button.
